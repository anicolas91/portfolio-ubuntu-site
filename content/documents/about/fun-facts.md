## Fun Facts about me


### About Me

Hello! Thanks for visiting my website. I am a Research Engineer with a PhD in Aerospace Engineering and extensive experience in multi-physics simulations, data analysis, and problem-solving. 
<br/><br/> 
I am pretty good at streamlining complex processes, developing advanced FFT/FE models, and working with interdisciplinary teams. I have also extensive experience at reverse engineering legacy systems, cleaning up spaguetti code, and optimizing code for efficiency. 
<br/><br/> 
In my spare time I really enjoy studying foreign languages, reading Jane Austen, playing the violing somewhat poorly, and working on personal projects involving machine learning and MLOps.
