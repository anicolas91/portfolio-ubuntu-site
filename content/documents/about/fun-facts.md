## Fun Facts about me

::

<ul class="mcl-list mcl-list-warning">
  <li> I like to learn languages! Not only programming ones, some of the ones I speak include:</li>
  <li class="ml-md">Spanish (my mother tongue)</li>
  <li class="ml-md">English (bob's your uncle!)</li>
  <li class="ml-md">French (omelette AU fromage!)</li>
  <li class="ml-md">Korean (my husband's mother tongue)</li>
  <li class="ml-md">Japanese (I may like to watch anime every now and then)</li>
  <li class="ml-md">Chinese (I love painfully difficult languagues I guess)</li>

  <li> I have a pet bird! His name is Manguito and he is a lovebird! He is pure evil. We call him El Pollo/Chicken/Evil Bird. He's a very tough code reviewer. Here's a picture!</li>

  <li> I play the violin! not great though... actually a cat makes better sounds than me. My neighbors absolutely "love" it.</li>
  <li> I did not watch Lord of the Rings until I was like 30. Then I watched them all in one sitting, director's cut version. Now I really, REALLY like LOTR! And now its a Christmas tradition to watch them all while questioning Frodo's life choices. </li>
  <li> I like running! To  the kitchen, to the bed, to the couch... I kid. I actually do enjoy running, as long as it is just a 5K. Longer than that and I get quite bored. My favorite part of 5Ks is getting my "free" shirt and having breakfast afterwards. </li>
  <li> I may perhaps have a somewhat unhealthy obsession with socks. Let's not go there. Just let it be known that A) I LOVE getting socks for Christmas and B) my husband HATES that I get too many socks for Christmas.</li>
</ul>
