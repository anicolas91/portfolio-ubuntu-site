## Work Experience

::

::abstract

My professional experience focuses on predicting behaviors efficiently by using strong statistical data analysis and modeling. I've worked with a variety of multi-physics simulations, including structural, vibrational, and fluid dynamics, and I apply best practices to optimize data processing, like vectorization, parallelization, and compression.
<br></br>
I especially enjoy speeding up processes, uncovering correlations and patterns, and creating visually appealing graphs. I also love collaborating with fantastic people—bonus points if I get to do all of this together!

### Intel
#### Research and Development Engineer
2021-present | Phoenix, AZ
<br></br>
<ul class="mcl-list mcl-list-warning mb-md">
  <li>Created a regression model to predict manufacturing risk early in the product lifecycle, reducing resource waste by 30% by prioritizing high-viability projects and enhancing late-stage performance. Feature engineering & Principal Component Analysis used. </li>
  <li>Developed and validated various softwares and tools that could model the layered deposition of materials during manufacturing.</li>
  <li>Co-developed software using multi-objective Bayesian optimization to recommend optimal product designs and manufacturing processes, hitting 100% of performance targets compared to 50-75% with manual methods. This software is part of a suite of tools designed to create digital twins of packaging substrates.</li>
  <li>Refactored the main software engine and streamlined the overall pipeline, simplifying a 3-month+10 engineer process to a 1-week+1 engineer process. Vectorization and parallel processing were used to speed up the core engine. </li>
  <li>Implemented version control, regular documentation, unit testing, e2e testing, and SCRUM.</li>
</ul>

### Purdue University- AAE
#### Research Assistant
2014-2019 | West Lafayette, IN
<br></br>
<ul class="mcl-list mcl-list-warning mb-md">
  <li> Generated a crack prediction parametric model using feature engineering and large datasets (60M+ datapoints) of aerospace material data. The model accurately predicted the crack initiation site for 4/4 of test case scenarios. </li>
  <li> The model showed that cracking resulted from the joint effect of microstructure, localized stress, and corrosion profile.</li>
  <li> Stress/strain calculations done with FFT, data analysis done via Gaussian Processing + Principal Component Analysis, data via HDF5. </li>
