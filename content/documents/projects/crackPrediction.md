My main PhD work focused on studying corrosion in aerospace-grade aluminum (AA7050), and evaluating the driving forces behind material degradation and the onset of cracking.
<br></br>

Some of the main tasks behind this work included:
<br></br>

<ul class="mcl-list mcl-list-warning mb-md">
  <li>Generating Fourier-based FFT mechanical models from both experimental data and statistical reconstructions.</li>
  <li>Extracting experimental data from corroded aluminum specimens via EBSD, SEM, EDX, and confocal microscopy.</li>
  <li>Statistically analyzing spatial data to find significant parameters related to corrosion growth and cracking. </li>
  <li class="text-warning">Developing a parametric crack prediction model by calculating fatigue indicator parameters (FIPs) that properly represented the opening behavior of a crack tip.</li>
  <li>Reconstructing and modeling big datasets with 60M+ datapoints each.</li>
</ul>

The major research outcomes were:
<br></br>

<ul class="mcl-list mcl-list-warning mb-md">
  <li>We found that the driving mechanisms behind early galvanic corrosion is led by cathodic particles.</li>
  <li class="text-warning">We learned that the transition from corrosion pits to cracking is a result from the joint effect of microstructure, localized stress, and the corrosion profile.</li>
  <li>We determined that the FIPs where a good parametrization metric that accurately predicted crack initiation on all cases.</li>
  <li class="text-secondary">We concluded that the microstructure is vital in affecting the pit-to-crack transition, with constituent particles playing a secondary role overall.</li>
</ul>
