## Why Simpler ML Models Are Often Better: A Case for Starting Simple

::

::abstract

In the rush to apply machine learning (ML) to real-world problems, it's easy to get caught up in the allure of advanced models like deep neural networks, transformers, or ensemble methods. These state-of-the-art techniques undoubtedly have their place, especially when working with highly complex datasets. However, there's an important lesson that often gets overlooked: sometimes, simpler ML models outperform more complex ones, and starting simple can offer multiple advantages.

### The Temptation of Complexity

In today's ML landscape, there are countless tools at our disposal, from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to gradient-boosting machines (GBMs) and everything in between. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance across tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. But, just because a model is sophisticated doesn't mean it's the right tool for every job.
<br></br>
In fact, <span class="text-warning">many real-world datasets don’t require complex architectures to achieve good results.</span> Instead, a simpler approach can not only perform just as well but also offer interpretability, efficiency, and ease of use.
<br></br>

### The Case for Simplicity

<li><u class="text-warning">Avoid Overfitting:</u> One of the biggest risks of using overly complex models is the potential for overfitting. This occurs when the model becomes too tuned to the training data, capturing noise rather than the true underlying patterns. Simpler models, such as linear regression or decision trees, are less prone to overfitting, especially when you have limited data.</li>
<li> <u class="text-warning">Improved Interpretability:</u> Simpler models tend to be more interpretable. For instance, a linear regression model provides clear insights into the relationships between features and the target variable. With complex models, such as deep neural networks, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand why the model made certain predictions, limiting explainability, which is crucial in industries like healthcare or finance.</li>
<li> <u class="text-warning">Efficiency and Speed:</u> Simpler models are often much faster to train and evaluate. This can be crucial in environments where computational resources are limited or when you need to iterate quickly. Models like k-nearest neighbors (KNN) or support vector machines (SVM) can often produce results in a fraction of the time it takes to train a deep neural network.</li>
<li> <u class="text-warning">Baseline Models</u> Starting with a simple model gives you a baseline to compare against. For example, a logistic regression model might achieve 85% accuracy on your dataset. If a more complex model like a random forest or neural network can't improve on that by much, it's a sign that complexity might not be adding value. Conversely, if the complex model substantially outperforms the baseline, then you know it's worth pursuing.</li>
<li> <u class="text-warning">Generalization:</u> In many cases, simpler models generalize better to new, unseen data. When the dataset is small or lacks significant complexity, advanced models can struggle to generalize as they may become overly tailored to the training set. Simpler models are better at finding the "essence" of the patterns in the data.</li>
<br></br>

### Real-World Example: Linear Models vs. Neural Networks

Imagine you're working on predicting house prices based on features such as square footage, location, and number of bedrooms. You could, of course, throw a neural network at the problem, but would it perform better than a simple linear regression?
<br></br>
<span class="text-warning">For many structured datasets (like tabular data), linear models often do remarkably well.</span> This is because many of the relationships between features and outcomes are linear or close to linear. A linear regression model might deliver comparable performance with far less tuning, and crucially, it will be easier to explain.
<br></br>
On the other hand, neural networks shine in situations where the data contains highly non-linear relationships, such as image recognition or text classification. But when you're dealing with structured data, the simplicity of linear models often wins.
<br></br>

### When to Use Complex Models

This isn’t to say that complex models are unnecessary or should be avoided altogether. Deep learning techniques, for instance, are powerful tools that enable breakthroughs in computer vision, NLP, and other areas. But it's essential to know when their complexity is truly needed.
<br></br>
<li> <u class="text-warning">High-Dimensional Data:</u> When working with very large, high-dimensional datasets (e.g., images, videos, or genetic data), more complex models can capture intricate patterns that simpler models might miss.</li>
<li> <u class="text-warning">Non-Linear Relationships:</u> If your data exhibits non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, models like neural networks, SVMs with non-linear kernels, or gradient-boosted trees may capture those dependencies better than linear models.</li>
<li> <u class="text-warning">Unstructured Data:</u> For tasks involving unstructured data like text or images, advanced architectures like convolutional networks (for images) or transformers (for text) are often necessary.</li>
<br></br>

### A Practical Approach: Start Simple, Scale Up

<span class="text-warning">The best approach is to begin with the simplest possible model and then incrementally increase the complexity.</span> This allows you to understand your data better and avoid wasted effort. Often, simpler models can give you a robust baseline that can later be fine-tuned with more advanced techniques. When the simpler model hits its performance limits, you can confidently explore more complex models, knowing you have squeezed as much performance out of the simpler options.
<br></br>

### Conclusion

In machine learning, more complexity doesn’t always translate to better results. Simpler models frequently provide solid performance, interpretability, and efficiency. By starting simple and gradually increasing the model complexity as needed, you can save time and resources while achieving the best possible outcomes. So the next time you tackle a new machine learning problem, resist the urge to dive straight into deep learning—start with the basics, and you might be surprised at how far they can take you.
