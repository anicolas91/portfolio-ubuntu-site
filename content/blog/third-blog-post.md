## Docker vs. Virtual Machines: A Quick Comparison

::

::abstract

When it comes to isolating applications and managing environments, Docker and virtual machines (VMs) are two popular solutions, but they serve different purposes and have distinct advantages. In this post, we’ll briefly explore the differences, pros, and cons of each, and discuss when you might want to use Docker over a VM, or vice versa.

### What is Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into isolated containers. Each container runs on the same operating system kernel but is completely isolated from other containers, ensuring that software behaves the same, regardless of where it's run.
<br></br>

#### Key Features of Docker:
<li><u class="text-warning">Lightweight:</u> Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more resource-efficient than full virtual machines.</li>
<li><u class="text-warning">Fast Start-Up:</u> Since containers don’t need to boot an entire OS, they can start and stop quickly.</li>
<li><u class="text-warning">Portability:</u> Docker containers can run consistently across different environments (local machines, servers, clouds).</li>
<li><u class="text-warning">Microservices Support:</u> Docker is ideal for breaking down applications into smaller, more manageable services (microservices).</li>
<br></br>

### What are Virtual Machines?
Virtual machines (VMs), on the other hand, are full-fledged operating systems running on top of a hypervisor. Each VM includes its own kernel, OS, libraries, and applications, making it an isolated unit with complete system-level independence.
<br></br>

#### Key Features of VMs:
<li><u class="text-warning">Complete Isolation:</u> VMs are fully isolated, with their own OS and kernel, which makes them ideal for running completely different environments or operating systems.</li>
<li><u class="text-warning">More Secure:</u> VMs offer better security because they are fully isolated from the host system and other VMs.</li>
Heavyweight: VMs are more resource-intensive as each VM needs its own OS, which takes up significant memory and disk space.
<li><u class="text-warning">Longer Boot Time:</u> Since each VM has to boot a full OS, it takes longer to start up compared to a Docker container.</li>
<br></br>

### Conclusion
Docker and virtual machines each have their strengths depending on the use case. Docker is ideal for lightweight, scalable applications and microservices that need to be deployed consistently across multiple platforms. On the other hand, virtual machines provide complete isolation and are better suited for running multiple operating systems or applications that require greater security.
